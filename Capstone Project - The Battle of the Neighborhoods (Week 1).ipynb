We could also need to find out about any banks and food and drink shops? It would be better to understand or make good choices about where the hotel will be built\n",

The algorithm used is k-means clustering. The main idea is to determine neighborhood with venues clustered around each other so that one can make a decision on the right neighborhood to chose based on the proximity of amenities and venues to each other."
